I chose to make a mountain side scene with a cozy house, dog play that runs around eating chickens.

The animals I used: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/animals-free-animated-low-poly-3d-models-260727

The scene: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/mountain-terrain-rocks-and-tree-97905

The House: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/lowpoly-baker-s-house-26443

I made an "EatChicken" script that destroys the chicken and updated your "score" in the top left hand corner
I also made a "MoreChicken" script that shuts the renderer off for some chickens for the first ten and a hlaf second then makes them appear so you have more chickens to eat.
